## 🚀 Core Components

**1. Data Pipeline**
Audio resampled to 8kHz with structured Mel-spectrogram extraction (64 filter banks, 25ms window) ensuring consistent feature representation across devices and recording conditions.

**2. Embedding Model — ECAPA-TDNN**
Fine-tuned on Mozilla Common Voice (Urdu) + VoxCeleb subsets for:
- Channel variability robustness
- Noise-resilient speaker discrimination
- Improved Urdu phoneme recognition

**3. Scoring & Calibration**
Cosine similarity scoring with z-norm and s-norm normalization stabilizes decision thresholds across microphone types, telephony channels, and acoustic environments.

**4. Liveness Detection**
Dynamic challenge-response prompts prevent replay attacks and pre-recorded spoofing, adding a behavioural verification layer on top of biometric matching.

**5. Inference Layer**
FastAPI-based deployment supporting low-latency, concurrent verification requests with Docker containerization for portable production deployment.

## 🔬 Experimental Focus

- Cross-channel verification: telephony (8kHz) vs. microphone recordings
- Impact of z-norm vs. s-norm on EER reduction
- FAR/FRR trade-off tuning across decision thresholds
- Embedding stability analysis under varying SNR conditions
